# Berana-Trans: Label Studio Visual Verification Stack
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE:
#   Runs a local Label Studio instance for visually verifying the accuracy
#   of our OpenCV Grid-Slicer on triple-column liturgical manuscripts.
#
# VOLUME MAPPING:
#   The pipeline outputs page images to: ../../output/visuals/
#   This compose file mounts that directory read-only into the container so
#   Label Studio can serve them over HTTP without database uploads.
#   Image URLs in our generated JSON tasks use: /data/local-files/?d=visuals/...
#
# REPRODUCIBILITY (PermissionError fix):
#   Label Studio's internal process must run as the SAME UID as the host
#   user who owns the mounted 'data/' directory. We achieve this by:
#     1. setup.sh writes HOST_UID and HOST_GID to this .env file.
#     2. The 'user:' directive below tells Docker to run the container process
#        with those exact IDs, so it can freely write to the mounted volume.
#   This eliminates the "[Errno 13] Permission denied: /label-studio/data/media"
#   error that occurs when Docker defaults to running as UID 0 (root) or UID 1001.
#
# FIRST RUN:
#   Ensure setup.sh has been run at least once to seed HOST_UID/HOST_GID.
#   Then: docker compose up -d
#   Dashboard: http://localhost:8080
